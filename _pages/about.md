I am a biological anthropologist interested in population genetics, epigenetics, ancient DNA, and human adaptation to environmental pressures.Â 

My research focuses on the population history and signatures of selection using ancient and modern DNA. 

Main study areas include Central Asia, Andes, and Nepal.
